Water Potability Prediction
Overview
This project aims to predict the potability of water based on various chemical and physical properties. The dataset contains features that describe water quality, and the goal is to classify whether the water is safe for human consumption.

Dataset
The dataset used is from Kaggle and includes the following features:

pH: pH of water
Hardness: Capacity of water to precipitate soap (mg/L)
Solids: Total dissolved solids (ppm)
Chloramines: Amount of Chloramines (ppm)
Sulfate: Amount of Sulfates (mg/L)
Conductivity: Electrical conductivity (μS/cm)
Organic Carbon: Amount of organic carbon (ppm)
Trihalomethanes: Amount of Trihalomethanes (μg/L)
Turbidity: Measure of light-emitting property (NTU)
Potability: Indicates if water is safe (0: Not Safe, 1: Safe)
Key Steps
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizations to understand data distribution and relationships.
Example: Distribution of pH levels.pH Distribution
Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values and scaling features.
Modeling:

Implemented several models:
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Decision Tree
Random Forest
XGBoost
Model Evaluation:

Accuracy scores and confusion matrices to assess model performance.
Example: Confusion Matrix for Random Forest.Confusion Matrix
Results
The models were evaluated, and the best-performing model was selected based on accuracy.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning to predict water potability, highlighting the importance of ensuring safe drinking water.
